            <h4>Clearing English Language Test- No More a Worry for Indian Doctors</h4>
            <p><img src="resume1.jpg" class="customblog-img" />Relaxing news is on its way for Indian doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who are looking to practise medicine in the UK. The road has become much simpler now for medical professionals as the country has changed its visa norms. This mainly involves by doing away with the requirement of two separate English tests, according to the British Council. Earlier the candidates had to clear two separate tests for registration within the UK and for immigration purposes with the relevant healthcare regulator. For non-native English speakers, the British Council conducts the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam."We are excited that the UK recently streamlined the English proficiency tests requirement for international healthcare professionals. This is excellent news for aspiring Indian and other international healthcare professionals, as now they're required to require an English exam just one occasion to enable them to figure in the UK," Michael King, director at British Council English and Examinations Services India Private Limited, said. Previous candidates had to take exams such as IELTS or OET to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council, the two healthcare boards in the United Kingdom, and also had to clear IELTS (UKVi) to apply for a visa. According to British Council, since English benchmark tested for registration as a healthcare professional was already high, duplicating the exercise was of no importance, and therefore the change in visa standards will make it smooth for healthcare professionals to practice medicine in the UK.</p>

The sector can earn $100 billion a year by simply training 5 million doctors, nurses, and technicians.

A growing preference for home-based care has prompted the need for trained nurses for patient care.
